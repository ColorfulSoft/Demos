# Preparing for launch

* Make sure that your computer supports the Microsoft .NET Framework technology. To run the codes, you will need a version of 3.0 or higher.
* If you are using Windows XP, you will most likely have to manually install the Microsoft .NET Framework. You can find detailed instructions for installing it on the official Microsoft website: https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/Download/confirmation.aspx?id=17718
* If you are using Windows 7 or higher, you already have Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or higher installed. In this case, no action is necessary.

# Loading and launching apps

* Download and unpack the current repository.
* If possible, place the unpacked folder in the root of a disk. This is necessary to reduce the length of the file name, because components of .NET Framework can sometimes work incorrectly with long names.
* Select the implementation you are interested in and go to its catalog. For example, if you want to run a Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, you need to go to the "StyleTransfer-Colorization-SuperResolution\Style Transfer\2015. A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style\"
* In the folder of the selected implementation, go to the implementation folder. It contains the source code of the project itself. In the folder you will find the "Compile.bat" file. Launch it, and wait a few seconds. You should see a "Release" folder containing a single file-the program that is ready to run.
* Run the resulting program and follow the instructions in the window that opens. The resulting executable file can be moved and even run on other computers where it is installed .NET Framework. The program does not have any specific dependencies.
* _Some specific instructions can be found in the README.md file in the folder of the project you selected._

# System requirements

* RAM: at least 1 GB.
* Operating system: Windows XP and higher; x64/x86.
* CPU: no specific requirements. The more powerful the better.
* The amount of free disk space to compile any single application: 200 MB.
* _We do not recommend running the presented applications in a VM._
