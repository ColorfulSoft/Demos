# Let there be Color! Joint End-to-end Learning of Global and Local Image Priors for Automatic Image Colorization with Simultaneous Classification
Coloring black-and-white images using one of the most powerful neural algorithms.

# The developers of the method: Satoshi Iizuka, Edgar Simo-Serra, Hiroshi Ishikawa
* Author's implementation: https://github.com/satoshiiizuka/siggraph2016_colorization
* Paper: http://iizuka.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/projects/colorization/en/ (also available in the "Paper" folder)

# Compile and launch the app
1. Go to the "Implementation" folder
2. Run the "Compile.bat" file. The "Release" will be created, and the "Let there be Color!.exe" file will appear in it
3. Go to the "Release" folder and run "Let there be Color!.exe"

# Minimum system requirements
* Windows XP and higher. Any bit depth.
* 1 GB of RAM.
* .NET Framework 4.0 and higher. The program may also run on .NET Framework 3.5.
